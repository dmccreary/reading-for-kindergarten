## Description

Letter Hunt is an engaging "search and find" game designed to build letter recognition and visual discrimination skills in kindergarten students. The screen displays a scattered arrangement of colorful letters, with a target letter shown prominently at the top. Children tap or click each instance of the target letter they find.

### Features

- **Visual Feedback**: Sparkle animations and growing effects reward correct letter finds
- **Audio Support**: Click the speaker icon to hear the target letter pronounced
- **Difficulty Levels**: Three levels that adjust letter density and introduce visually similar distractors
- **Large Touch Targets**: Letters are sized appropriately for developing fine motor skills
- **Progressive Challenge**: Easy mode uses distinct letters, while harder modes introduce confusable pairs (b/d, p/q, m/n)

### How to Play

1. Look at the target letter displayed at the top of the screen
2. Click the speaker icon to hear how the letter sounds
3. Find and click all instances of that letter in the play area
4. Watch for sparkles when you find a correct letter!
5. Click "New Game" to play with a different target letter
6. Adjust difficulty using the dropdown menu

## Learning Objectives

- **Letter Recognition**: Identify specific letters among distractors
- **Visual Discrimination**: Distinguish between similar-looking letters
- **Attention to Detail**: Scan systematically to find all target instances
- **Fine Motor Skills**: Practice clicking/tapping on specific targets

## Lesson Plan

### Introduction (2 minutes)
1. Show students the Letter Hunt game
2. Demonstrate how to identify the target letter at the top
3. Model clicking on matching letters and celebrate the sparkle feedback

### Guided Practice (5 minutes)
1. Play a round together as a class on Easy mode
2. Have students call out when they spot a target letter
3. Discuss strategies for finding all the letters (scan left to right, top to bottom)

### Independent Practice (10 minutes)
1. Students play individually or in pairs
2. Start on Easy mode, progress to Medium when comfortable
3. Challenge: Can you find all letters before clicking "New Game"?

### Discussion (3 minutes)
1. Which letters were easiest to find? Hardest?
2. What strategies helped you find all the letters?
3. Which letters look similar and might be confusing?

## Differentiation

- **Struggling Learners**: Stay on Easy mode with fewer letters and distinct shapes
- **Advanced Learners**: Try Hard mode with confusable letter pairs (b/d, p/q)
- **Visual Processing Support**: Encourage pointing at each letter before clicking

## Educational Standards Alignment

- **CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RF.K.1.D**: Recognize and name all upper- and lowercase letters
- **CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RF.K.1**: Demonstrate understanding of the organization and basic features of print
