# Interactive Simulations

This section contains MicroSims - interactive educational simulations.

## What are MicroSims?

MicroSims are small, focused interactive simulations that help students learn through hands-on exploration.

## Available MicroSims

| MicroSim | Description | Skills |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| [Graph Viewer](./graph-viewer/index.md) | Interactive visualization of the learning graph | Navigation |
| [Talking Letters](./talking-letters/index.md) | Click letters to hear pronunciation with speech synthesis | Letter Recognition |
| [Letter Matching Game](./letter-matching-game/index.md) | Match uppercase to lowercase letters with drag-and-drop | Letter Recognition |
| [Letter Hunt](./letter-hunt/index.md) | Find and click target letters in a search-and-find game | Letter Recognition, Visual Discrimination |

## Reusable Patterns

Several MicroSims include reusable code patterns that can be adapted for new simulations:

- **Letter Hunt** - Celebration animations (sparkles, star effects) and audio feedback (correct ding, win fanfare) using Web Audio API
