# Chapter 4: Hearing Sounds in Words

## Overview

This chapter develops phonemic awarenessthe ability to hear, identify, and manipulate individual sounds in spoken words. These listening skills are foundational for connecting letters to sounds and learning to read.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

- **Remember**: Identify rhyming words
- **Understand**: Recognize that words are made up of individual sounds (phonemes)
- **Apply**: Identify beginning, middle, and ending sounds in words
- **Analyze**: Break words into syllables and individual sounds

## Chapter Summary

Before children can connect letters to sounds, they need to hear and distinguish the sounds in words. This chapter focuses on listening activities that build phonemic awarenesshearing initial sounds, final sounds, rhymes, and syllables without focusing on letters.
