### Observations

1. **Letter Recognition (LETR)** is the largest category at 26.7%
   - This is expected as it includes all 52 letters (26 uppercase + 26 lowercase)
   - Does not exceed the 30% threshold

2. **Well-Balanced Categories**
   - Most categories fall between 5-12% of total concepts
   - No single category dominates the learning graph

3. **Appropriate Capstone Size**
   - Capstone Skills (5.1%) represents the culmination of learning
   - Reasonable proportion for final learning objectives

4. **Foundation-Heavy Structure**
   - Combined foundation-related categories (FOUND, LETR, CONS, VOWL) = 53.4%
   - Appropriate for kindergarten-level reading instruction

## Category Details

### FOUND - Foundation Concepts (15 concepts)
Core prerequisites including spoken language, listening, print awareness, and letter concepts.

### LETR - Letter Recognition (52 concepts)
All uppercase (A-Z) and lowercase (a-z) letters.

### PHON - Phonemic Awareness (13 concepts)
Sound awareness skills including initial/final/medial sounds, rhyming, and syllables.

### CONS - Consonant Sounds (23 concepts)
21 consonant letter sounds plus the general consonant concept.

### VOWL - Vowel Sounds (14 concepts)
5 short vowel sounds, 5 long vowel sounds, plus general vowel concepts.

### LINK - Letter-Sound Links (8 concepts)
Connecting letters to sounds, including formation and kinesthetic learning.

### BLND - Blending Skills (15 concepts)
Sound blending, word patterns (VC, CVC), and decoding.

### SGHT - Sight Words (20 concepts)
18 specific high-frequency sight words plus general sight word concepts.

### ASMT - Practice & Assessment (15 concepts)
Repetition, practice, mastery, fluency, and assessment concepts.

### APPL - Application Skills (10 concepts)
Word creation, manipulation, and pattern recognition.

### CAPS - Capstone Skills (10 concepts)
Independent reading and emergent reader skills.

## Recommendations

1. **No Over-Representation Issues**
   - All categories are within acceptable ranges
   - No category exceeds the 30% threshold

2. **Consider Future Expansion**
   - LINK category is smallest (4.1%) - could expand with more kinesthetic/multisensory concepts
   - APPL could include more word manipulation exercises

3. **Learning Path Balance**
   - Good progression from foundation → skills → application → capstone
   - Categories support multiple learning pathways
