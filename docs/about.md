# About This Intelligent Textbook

This intelligent textbook is designed for people involved in teaching reading skills to kindergarten students through interactive lessons, engaging simulations, and structured learning paths.

The development of this textbook was a challenge for me since this was the first textbook
that speech synthesis was required.  Our goal is to allow the MicroSim to all
run on the p5.js editor, which precluded the use of complex speech synthesis JavaScript
libraries.  A secondary goal was to avoid the use of complex sound file downloads
that can slow application startup times.  However, we found the
the quality of speech synthesis on the browser is limited and the ability to generate individual phoneme sounds was not possible.
