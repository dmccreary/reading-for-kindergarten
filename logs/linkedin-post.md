# LinkedIn Post - Reading for Kindergarten MicroSims

## Post Text

Excited to share a free, open-source resource for early literacy: **Reading for Kindergarten** - an intelligent textbook with 21 interactive MicroSims designed to help young learners develop essential reading skills.

The MicroSims cover the complete early reading journey:

- Letter Recognition (Talking Letters, Letter Matching, Letter Hunt, Letter Tracing)
- Phonemic Awareness (First Sound Finder, Sound Counter, Rhyme Time)
- Letter-Sound Correspondence (Consonant Sound Match, Vowel Explorer)
- Blending (CVC Word Builder, Sound Slider, Word Machine)
- Sight Words (Flashcards, Memory Game, Bingo)

**New: Reading Progress Path**

We just added a visual learning journey map that connects all the MicroSims together. Students can:

- See how reading skills build on each other
- Click activities to open them in new tabs
- Earn stars as they complete each activity
- Track their progress across all skill areas

The progress tracking uses browser localStorage - simple, private, and requires no accounts or logins.

All MicroSims use p5.js for graphics and the Web Speech API for audio pronunciation, making them engaging and accessible for kindergarten students.

The entire project is open source on GitHub. Teachers, parents, and developers are welcome to use, adapt, and contribute.

New feature: The **Reading Progress Path** gives students a visual learning journey, opening activities in new tabs and tracking progress with stars.

No accounts needed. No ads. Just learning.
