## Overview

Reading for Kindergarten is an interactive, AI-generated intelligent textbook designed to teach foundational reading skills to kindergarten students (ages 5-6). Built using MkDocs with the Material theme, it incorporates learning graphs, concept dependencies, and interactive visualizations to create an engaging learning experience.

The textbook follows Bloom's Taxonomy (2001 revision) for learning outcomes and uses concept dependency graphs to ensure proper prerequisite sequencing. Content progresses from foundational concepts like spoken language and print awareness through letter recognition, phonemic awareness, phonics, and ultimately to independent reading skills.

Whether you're a parent teaching your child to read, a kindergarten teacher looking for structured curriculum materials, or an educator exploring AI-assisted educational content, this textbook provides comprehensive coverage of early literacy skills with a carefully designed learning progression.
