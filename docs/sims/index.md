# Interactive Simulations

This section contains MicroSims - interactive educational simulations designed to help kindergarten students learn reading skills through hands-on exploration.

!!! tip "Start with the Reading Progress Path"
    For the best experience, use the **[Reading Progress Path](./reading-progress-path/index.md)** to navigate through all MicroSims. It opens each activity in a new tab and tracks your progress with stars. This helps students see their learning journey and keeps track of which activities they've completed.

## What are MicroSims?

MicroSims are small, focused interactive simulations that teach specific reading skills. Each MicroSim uses p5.js for graphics, Web Speech API for audio, and provides immediate feedback to keep young learners engaged.

## Reusable Patterns

Several MicroSims include reusable code patterns that can be adapted for new simulations:

- **Celebration Animations** - Sparkles, confetti, star effects for rewards
- **Audio Feedback** - Correct/incorrect sounds, success fanfares using Web Audio API
- **Speech Synthesis** - Letter sounds, word pronunciation, instructions
- **Drag and Drop** - Touch-friendly tile manipulation
- **Progress Tracking** - Stars, counters, completion states
