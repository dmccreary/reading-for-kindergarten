## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

After completing this activity, students will be able to:

1. **Remember**: Recognize high-frequency sight words instantly
2. **Understand**: Use sight words correctly in sentence context
3. **Apply**: Read sight words fluently within connected text
4. **Evaluate**: Self-assess which words are mastered vs. need more practice

### What Are Sight Words?

Sight words are high-frequency words that readers need to recognize instantly, without sounding them out:

- They appear frequently in children's books and everyday reading
- Many don't follow regular phonics rules (e.g., "the," "said," "you")
- Automatic recognition frees brain power for comprehension
- The Dolch list contains 220 words that make up 50-75% of text in children's books

### Suggested Activities

1. **Daily Practice**: Review 5-10 words each day
2. **Word Hunt**: Find sight words in classroom books
3. **Sentence Building**: Create sentences using learned sight words
4. **Partner Quiz**: Students test each other on known words
5. **Word Wall**: Add mastered words to a classroom display

### Assessment Opportunities

- Track which words students mark as "known"
- Listen to students read the words aloud
- Observe automaticity (instant recognition vs. hesitation)
- Have students use words in their own sentences

### Differentiation

- **Support**: Focus on 5 words at a time; use "Hear" button frequently
- **Challenge**: Time how quickly students can read all 40 words; add primer list words

### Teaching Sequence

1. Introduce 3-5 new words per session
2. Practice with flashcards until automatic
3. Find words in decodable readers
4. Review previously learned words regularly
5. Celebrate when all 40 words are mastered!
