## About This MicroSim

The Letter Motion Maker turns letters into full-body movements, supporting kinesthetic learners and providing movement breaks during literacy instruction. Each letter is paired with a memorable body motion—arms up like a tent for "A," arms crossed for "X." A stick figure demonstrates each pose while spoken instructions guide the movement.

### Features

- **26 Letters**: Complete alphabet with unique motions
- **Stick Figure Demo**: Animated demonstration of each pose
- **Spoken Instructions**: Audio guidance for each motion
- **Progress Tracking**: Count of letters practiced
- **Emoji Hints**: Visual memory cues for each letter
- **Letter Cards**: Large letter display with associated symbol
- **Self-Paced**: "I Did It!" button advances after practice

### Letter Motions

| Letter | Motion | Symbol |
|--------|--------|--------|
| A | Arms up in a point like a tent | ⛺ |
| B | Hands on belly, stick out tummy | 🤰 |
| C | Curve arms like holding a ball | 🏀 |
| M | Arms up, hands touch at top | ⛰️ |
| O | Arms in big circle in front | ⭕ |
| T | Arms straight out to sides | ✝️ |
| X | Cross arms in front | ❌ |
| Y | Arms up in Y shape | 🙌 |

### How to Use

1. **See the Letter**: View the letter and emoji hint
2. **Read Instructions**: See what motion to make
3. **Show Motion**: Click to see stick figure demo
4. **Stand Up**: Get ready to move!
5. **Make the Shape**: Form the letter with your body
6. **Say the Sound**: Speak the letter sound while moving
7. **I Did It!**: Click to record and advance

## Iframe Example

You can include this MicroSim on your website using the following `iframe`:

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

After completing this activity, students will be able to:

1. **Remember**: Associate letters with specific body movements
2. **Understand**: Explain how letter shapes relate to physical poses
3. **Apply**: Perform movements that represent letter shapes
4. **Create**: Combine movements to spell simple words

### Why Kinesthetic Learning Works

Movement supports letter learning because:

- **Multiple pathways**: Engages body memory alongside visual/auditory
- **Active learning**: Movement increases engagement and attention
- **Memory encoding**: Physical actions create stronger memories
- **Energy release**: Provides appropriate outlets for wiggly learners
- **Letter shape awareness**: Body positions reinforce letter forms

### Suggested Activities

1. **Letter Freeze**: Move to music, freeze in letter shape when it stops
2. **Spell Your Name**: Make motions for each letter in your name
3. **Letter Chain**: Students each make one letter to spell a word
4. **ABC Song with Motions**: Sing alphabet while making all 26 poses
5. **Letter Charades**: One student makes motion, others guess letter

### Assessment Opportunities

- Observe correct letter-motion associations
- Note which letters are formed correctly
- Listen for letter sounds during movements
- Track practice completion across all 26 letters

### Differentiation

- **Support**: Focus on 5-6 letters at a time; use peer modeling
- **Challenge**: Speed rounds; spell words with motions

### Integration Ideas

- **Morning Meeting**: Letter of the Day motion
- **Transitions**: Spell destination with motions (L-U-N-C-H)
- **Brain Breaks**: Quick alphabet movement session
- **Spelling Practice**: Motion out spelling words

### Physical Considerations

- Ensure adequate space for movement
- Modify motions for students with physical limitations
- Seated alternatives available for each motion
- Supervision for safety during movement

## Technical Notes

- Uses p5.js for interactive graphics and animations
- Web Speech API for letter and instruction pronunciation
- Web Audio API for feedback sounds
- Stick figure drawn with basic shapes and lines
- Touch and mouse support for all controls
- Responsive design adapts to container width
