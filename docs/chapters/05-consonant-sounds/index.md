# Chapter 5: Consonant Sounds

## Overview

This chapter introduces the sounds that consonant letters make. Children will learn to associate each consonant letter with its most common sound, building the foundation for decoding words.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

- **Remember**: Produce the sound for each consonant letter
