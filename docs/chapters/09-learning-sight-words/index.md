# Chapter 9: Learning Sight Words

## Overview

This chapter introduces high-frequency sight wordscommon words that children should recognize instantly without sounding out. These words appear frequently in text and include many words that don't follow regular phonics patterns.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

- **Remember**: Instantly recognize common sight words
- **Understand**: Explain why some words need to be memorized
- **Apply**: Read sentences containing sight words fluently

## Chapter Summary

Sight words (also called high-frequency words) are words that appear so often in text that children need to recognize them instantly. Some sight words follow phonics rules (like "and" and "it"), while others don't (like "the" and "said"). Learning these words by heart helps children read more fluently.
