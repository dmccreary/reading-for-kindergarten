## About This MicroSim

The Consonant Sound Match MicroSim helps kindergarten students learn the primary sounds of consonant letters through self-directed exploration. Clicking any letter plays its sound and shows an example word with a picture, building audio-visual associations that strengthen memory.

### Features

- **21 Consonants**: All consonant letters displayed in a colorful grid
- **Sound Pronunciation**: Each letter's primary sound is spoken
- **Example Words**: Common words that start with each sound
- **Emoji Pictures**: Visual associations for each example word
- **Uppercase & Lowercase**: Both letter forms displayed together
- **Visual Feedback**: Animated selection with sparkle effects
- **Repeat Button**: Hear any letter's sound again

### How to Use

1. **Click** any consonant letter in the grid
2. **Listen** to the letter's sound being pronounced
3. **See** the example word and picture
4. **Learn** the letter-sound connection
5. **Explore** other letters freely
6. **Click "Hear Again"** to repeat the current letter's sound

### Consonant Sounds Covered

| Letter | Sound | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| B | /b/ | ball |
| C | /k/ | cat |
| D | /d/ | dog |
| F | /f/ | fish |
| G | /g/ | goat |
| H | /h/ | hat |
| J | /j/ | jam |
| K | /k/ | kite |
| L | /l/ | lion |
| M | /m/ | moon |
| N | /n/ | nest |
| P | /p/ | pig |
| Q | /kw/ | queen |
| R | /r/ | rain |
| S | /s/ | sun |
| T | /t/ | turtle |
| V | /v/ | van |
| W | /w/ | water |
| X | /ks/ | fox |
| Y | /y/ | yellow |
| Z | /z/ | zebra |

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

After completing this activity, students will be able to:

1. **Remember**: Recall the primary sound for each consonant letter
2. **Understand**: Explain how a consonant's sound appears at the beginning of words
3. **Apply**: Identify the beginning sound in new words
4. **Analyze**: Compare similar consonant sounds (like C and K)

### Suggested Activities

1. **Letter of the Day**: Focus on one letter, finding objects in the room that start with that sound
2. **Sound Hunt**: After exploring letters, go on a hunt for items that start with a chosen sound
3. **Name Game**: Connect letters to students' names that start with each sound
4. **Sound Sort**: Sort picture cards by beginning consonant sound

### Assessment Opportunities

- Observe which letters students explore most and least
- Ask students to identify the sound of specific letters
- Have students generate words that start with target sounds

### Differentiation

- **Support**: Focus on a subset of consonants first (B, M, S, T are good starters)
- **Challenge**: Ask students to think of additional words for each letter

### Teaching Notes

- C and K make the same /k/ sound - acknowledge this connection
- X rarely makes its sound at the beginning of words (fox, box use ending /ks/)
- Some letters have multiple sounds (C: cat vs. city) - this focuses on primary sounds

## Technical Notes

- Uses p5.js for interactive graphics
- Web Speech API for sound pronunciation
- Web Audio API for selection tones
- Touch and mouse input supported
- Responsive design adapts to container width
