# Chapter 7: Connecting Letters and Sounds

## Overview

This chapter strengthens the connection between letters and their sounds through multisensory activities. Children will practice letter formation while saying sounds, building strong letter-sound associations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

- **Remember**: Automatically recall sounds when seeing letters
- **Understand**: Explain how letters represent sounds
- **Apply**: Write letters while saying their sounds

## Chapter Summary

Strong readers instantly connect letters to sounds without thinking. This chapter uses kinesthetic (movement-based) and multisensory techniques to cement letter-sound relationships. By tracing, writing, and physically forming letters while saying sounds, children build automatic recognition.
