# Concept Taxonomy for Reading for Kindergarten

This document defines the categorical taxonomy for organizing concepts in the learning graph.

## Taxonomy Categories

| Category Name | TaxonomyID | Description |
|--------------|------------|-------------|
| Foundation Concepts | FOUND | Core prerequisite concepts including spoken language, listening, and print awareness |
| Letter Recognition | LETR | Individual letter concepts (uppercase and lowercase) |
| Phonemic Awareness | PHON | Skills related to hearing and manipulating sounds in words |
| Consonant Sounds | CONS | Individual consonant sounds and letter-sound correspondence |
| Vowel Sounds | VOWL | Short and long vowel sounds |
| Letter-Sound Links | LINK | Connecting letters to their sounds, including formation and kinesthetic learning |
| Blending Skills | BLND | Sound blending, word patterns, and decoding skills |
| Sight Words | SGHT | High-frequency sight words |
| Practice & Assessment | ASMT | Repetition, practice, mastery, and assessment concepts |
| Application Skills | APPL | Word creation, manipulation, and pattern recognition |
| Capstone Skills | CAPS | Independent reading and emergent reader skills |

## Category Descriptions

### FOUND - Foundation Concepts
Concepts that form the basic prerequisites for reading instruction. These include oral language skills, listening abilities, and awareness of print and books.

**ConceptIDs**: 1-15

### LETR - Letter Recognition
Individual letter concepts covering both uppercase (A-Z) and lowercase (a-z) letter recognition.

**ConceptIDs**: 16-67

### PHON - Phonemic Awareness
Skills for identifying, isolating, and manipulating individual sounds (phonemes) in spoken words. Includes rhyming, syllable awareness, and sound segmentation.

**ConceptIDs**: 68-80

### CONS - Consonant Sounds
The sounds associated with consonant letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z).

**ConceptIDs**: 81-103

### VOWL - Vowel Sounds
Short and long vowel sounds for the five vowel letters (A, E, I, O, U).

**ConceptIDs**: 104-117

### LINK - Letter-Sound Links
Concepts connecting visual letters to their sounds, including letter formation, tracing, and kinesthetic approaches.

**ConceptIDs**: 118-125

### BLND - Blending Skills
The process of combining individual sounds to form words. Includes VC and CVC word patterns, oral blending, and decoding.

**ConceptIDs**: 126-140

### SGHT - Sight Words
High-frequency words that students learn to recognize by sight (the, a, is, it, in, to, and, I, can, we, see, my, like, go, he, she, you, are).

**ConceptIDs**: 141-160

### ASMT - Practice & Assessment
Concepts related to practicing skills, achieving mastery, and monitoring student progress.

**ConceptIDs**: 161-175

### APPL - Application Skills
Higher-level skills where students apply their knowledge to create and manipulate words.

**ConceptIDs**: 176-185

### CAPS - Capstone Skills
Advanced skills representing the culmination of kindergarten reading instruction, including independent reading.

**ConceptIDs**: 186-195
