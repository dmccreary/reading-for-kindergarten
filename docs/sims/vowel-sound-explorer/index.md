## About This MicroSim

The Vowel Sound Explorer helps kindergarten students understand that vowels are special letters that can make different sounds. Each vowel can make both a "short" sound and a "long" sound (its name). This MicroSim allows children to explore both sound types through interactive discovery.

### Features

- **All 5 Vowels**: A, E, I, O, U displayed prominently
- **Two Sound Modes**: Toggle between short and long vowel sounds
- **Visual Markers**: Breve (˘) for short sounds, macron (¯) for long sounds
- **Example Words**: Common words for each vowel sound
- **Emoji Pictures**: Visual associations for each example
- **Color Coding**: Each vowel has its own color
- **Audio Playback**: Hear sounds and example words spoken

### How to Use

1. **Select Mode**: Click "Short Sounds" or "Long Sounds" to choose
2. **Click a Vowel**: Tap any vowel letter to hear its sound
3. **Listen**: Hear the vowel sound and an example word
4. **Learn**: See the example word and picture
5. **Compare**: Switch modes to hear how the same vowel sounds different

### Vowel Sounds

| Vowel | Short Sound | Example | Long Sound | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|------------|---------|
| A | /a/ (ah) | apple | /ā/ (ay) | cake |
| E | /e/ (eh) | egg | /ē/ (ee) | tree |
| I | /i/ (ih) | igloo | /ī/ (eye) | ice |
| O | /o/ (oh) | octopus | /ō/ (oh) | boat |
| U | /u/ (uh) | umbrella | /ū/ (you) | unicorn |

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

After completing this activity, students will be able to:

1. **Remember**: Recall that vowels can make two different sounds
2. **Understand**: Explain the difference between short and long vowel sounds
3. **Apply**: Identify whether a vowel sound is short or long in simple words
4. **Analyze**: Compare short and long sounds for the same vowel

### Key Concepts

- **Short Vowels**: Make a quick sound (apple, egg, igloo, octopus, umbrella)
- **Long Vowels**: Say their name (cake, tree, ice, boat, unicorn)
- **Visual Markers**: Breve (˘) marks short sounds, macron (¯) marks long sounds

### Suggested Activities

1. **Sound Sort**: Sort picture cards by short or long vowel sounds
2. **Name Check**: Determine if each student's name has short or long vowels
3. **Word Hunt**: Find classroom objects with short or long vowel sounds
4. **Body Sounds**: Stand up for long sounds, crouch for short sounds

### Assessment Opportunities

- Ask students to identify if a word has a short or long vowel sound
- Have students generate words with target vowel sounds
- Observe which vowel pairs cause the most confusion

### Differentiation

- **Support**: Focus on one vowel at a time; use kinesthetic movements
- **Challenge**: Introduce words where context affects vowel sound (e.g., "use" vs. "us")

### Teaching Notes

- Long vowel sounds are the same as vowel names - helpful for students who know letter names
- Short vowel sounds are often harder to learn because they're less distinct
- The macron and breve symbols are standard phonics notation

## Technical Notes

- Uses p5.js for interactive graphics
- Web Speech API for sound pronunciation
- Web Audio API for selection tones
- Touch and mouse input supported
- Responsive design adapts to container width
