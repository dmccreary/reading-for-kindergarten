## About This MicroSim

The Reading Progress Path provides a visual overview of the reading journey, showing how skills build on each other from letter recognition to fluent reading. Each station on the path represents a skill area with links to related MicroSims. Progress is visualized through stars, motivating continued practice.

### Features

- **6 Skill Stations**: Letters, Sounds, Letter-Sound, Blending, Sight Words, Reading
- **Visual Path**: Winding road connecting skill areas
- **Progress Stars**: Track completion of activities
- **Detail Panels**: Click stations to see activities
- **Color Coding**: Each skill area has unique color
- **Emoji Icons**: Visual representation of each skill
- **Total Progress**: Overall star count displayed

### Skill Stations

| Station | Skills | Activities |
|---------|--------|------------|
| 🔤 Letters | Letter recognition | Talking Letters, Letter Matching, Letter Hunt, Letter Tracing |
| 👂 Sounds | Phonemic awareness | First Sound Finder, Sound Counter, Word Counter, Rhyme Time |
| 🔊 Letter-Sound | Letter-sound correspondence | Consonant Sound Match, Vowel Explorer, Sound-to-Letter, Letter Keyboard |
| 🧩 Blending | Sound blending | CVC Word Builder, VC Blender, Sound Slider, Word Machine |
| 👀 Sight Words | High-frequency words | Flashcards, Memory Game, Bingo |
| 📖 Reading! | Putting it together | Nonsense Words, Letter Motion Maker |

### How to Use

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

After using this MicroSim, students and teachers will be able to:

1. **Remember**: Identify the main skill areas in learning to read
2. **Understand**: Explain how reading skills build on each other
3. **Apply**: Navigate to appropriate activities for their skill level
4. **Evaluate**: Track their own progress through the reading journey

### The Reading Development Sequence

The path reflects research-based reading development:

1. **Letter Recognition**: Foundation of all reading
2. **Phonemic Awareness**: Hearing sounds in words
3. **Letter-Sound Correspondence**: Connecting letters to sounds
4. **Blending**: Combining sounds into words
5. **Sight Words**: Automatic word recognition
6. **Reading**: Putting all skills together

### Suggested Activities

1. **Journey Introduction**: Use path to explain the reading learning journey
2. **Goal Setting**: "Let's work on the Blending station today"
3. **Progress Celebration**: Review stars earned at week's end
4. **Skill Assessment**: Identify which stations need more practice
5. **Parent Communication**: Share progress path with families

### Assessment Opportunities

- Use star counts to identify mastery areas
- Note which stations students gravitate toward
- Track overall progress across skill areas
- Identify skill gaps for targeted instruction

### Differentiation

- **Support**: Focus on one station at a time; celebrate small wins
- **Challenge**: Set goals for star completion; time trials

### Classroom Integration

The Progress Path serves as:

- **Visual curriculum map**: Shows the scope of reading instruction
- **Student motivation tool**: Makes progress visible
- **Navigation hub**: Links to all MicroSims
- **Assessment dashboard**: Quick view of skill development
- **Parent communication**: Easy-to-understand progress report
