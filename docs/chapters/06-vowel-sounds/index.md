# Chapter 6: Vowel Sounds

## Overview

This chapter introduces the vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and their sounds. Children will learn that each vowel makes both a short sound and a long sound, with a focus on short vowel sounds for beginning readers.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

- **Remember**: Name the five vowels
- **Understand**: Explain the difference between short and long vowel sounds
- **Apply**: Produce short vowel sounds in CVC words

## Chapter Summary

Vowels are special letters because every word needs at least one! The five vowels (A, E, I, O, U) each make two main sounds: a short sound and a long sound. Beginning readers start with short vowel sounds, which appear in simple words like "cat," "bed," and "pig."
