# Chapter 8: Blending Sounds into Words

## Overview

This chapter teaches children to blend individual sounds together to read words. Starting with simple two-sound words and progressing to three-sound (CVC) words, children will develop essential decoding skills.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

- **Remember**: Recognize common word patterns (VC, CVC)
- **Understand**: Explain how sounds blend together to make words
- **Apply**: Blend sounds to read simple words
- **Analyze**: Decode unfamiliar CVC words

## Chapter Summary

Blending is the key skill that turns letter sounds into real words. This chapter teaches children to smoothly connect sounds together, starting with two sounds (VC words like "at") and building to three sounds (CVC words like "cat"). This is where reading begins!
