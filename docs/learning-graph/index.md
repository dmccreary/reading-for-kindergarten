# Learning Graph

Welcome to the Learning Graph section of Reading for Kindergarten.

## What is a Learning Graph?

A learning graph is a structured representation of how concepts in a course relate to each other. It shows:

- **Concept Dependencies**: Which concepts must be learned before others
- **Learning Pathways**: Multiple routes through the material
- **Concept Categories**: How concepts are organized by type

## Learning Graph Overview

The Reading for Kindergarten learning graph contains:

- **195 concepts** covering foundational reading skills
- **11 taxonomy categories** organizing concepts by type
- **265 dependencies** showing prerequisite relationships

## Taxonomy Categories

| Category | Description | Count |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Foundation Concepts | Core prerequisites (language, listening, print awareness) | 15 |
| Letter Recognition | Uppercase and lowercase letters | 52 |
| Phonemic Awareness | Sound awareness skills | 13 |
| Consonant Sounds | Individual consonant sounds | 23 |
| Vowel Sounds | Short and long vowel sounds | 14 |
| Letter-Sound Links | Connecting letters to sounds | 8 |
| Blending Skills | Sound blending and decoding | 15 |
| Sight Words | High-frequency words | 20 |
| Practice & Assessment | Mastery and assessment | 15 |
| Application Skills | Word creation and manipulation | 10 |
| Capstone Skills | Independent reading | 10 |

## Foundational Concepts

The learning graph has two foundational concepts (no prerequisites):

1. **Spoken Language** - The starting point for reading instruction
2. **Repetition** - The foundation for practice and mastery

## Longest Learning Path

The maximum dependency chain is 26 concepts, representing the full learning progression:

1. Spoken Language → Listening → Sounds → Speech → Words → Phoneme
2. → Phonemic Awareness → Sound Skills → Blending
3. → Word Reading → Decoding → Accuracy
4. → Assessment → Progress Monitoring

This demonstrates the comprehensive scope of kindergarten reading instruction.
